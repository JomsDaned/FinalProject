<b> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp About this website</b>

<p class="padding-box"> The Animals is a website where you can learn about the 
    problem of animal cruelty. Many animals are hurt or treated badly, and we want to help people 
    understand why this is wrong. Animals feel pain and deserve love, care, and kindness. Our website 
    shares stories, pictures, and facts about how animals suffer and how we can help them. 
    You will also learn about the causes of animal cruelty, like people not knowing how to care for
     animals or using them to make money. We talk about how we can work together to stop this and
      protect all animals. We believe every animal deserves a safe home, good food, and love. By 
      learning and sharing this information, we can inspire others to join us. Together, 
      we can make the world a better place for animals everywhere.. </center> </p>

    <p class="padding-box"> Animals are so important in our world, and they make 
        life better for everyone. They bring us happiness, love, and sometimes even help us with 
        work or as our friends. But sadly, not all animals are treated kindly. On our website, 
        we talk about ways to help animals, like adopting pets, volunteering, or supporting groups
         that keep animals safe. We also give tips on how to care for animals, like feeding them good
          food, giving them a safe home, and showing them love every day. </center> </p>
