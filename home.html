  <p style="clear: left; margin:3em">Animal cruelty happens for many reasons. Sometimes, people don’t know they are hurting animals. Others use animals to make money, like breeding animals for money. Also, the laws that protect animals are not enforced properly. These are the main reasons why animals are mistreated, and we need to fix them to stop animal cruelty.
